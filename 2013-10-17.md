Magnitude-dependent Automatic Alarms (MDA) 
-----  
* earthquake follow a stochastic process?  
* Rainfall relates with earthquakes?  
* Earthquake probability and metaphor  
* Rabbits Axioms  
--cannot turn a rate into a probability without assuming the phenomenon is random in the first place.  
* casino metaphor  
--the physics of earthquakes might be stochastic  
--stochastic model might provide a compact, accurate description of earthquake phenomenology.  
--stochastic model might be useful for predicting  
* common stochastic models for seismicity:  
--Poisson--doesnt fit  
--Poisson for "declustered"--standard algorithm dont remove enough events to get the test passed.   
--Gamma renewal--doesnt fit  
--ETAS(epidemic-type aftershock sequence)--doesnt fit  
* SCEC catalogs (1932-1971, 1932-2010)  
--decluster the catalog  
--when you have an earthquake with a certain magnitude, create a 'window', when 2 'windows' overlap, they combine to be a bigger window.  
--RI: every event creates a shadow, and link every event together.  
--dT: d-test, what's the largest event we can keep such that the rest events will follow the Poisson behavior.  
---how many events can be deleted and the rest will still pass the test of Poisson process  
---example: suppose observed 11 events in time-T, are these 11 events 11 iid samples?  
* MDA: 
--after every event with M>u, start an alarm of duration t  
--after a bigger event, should have an alarm for a long duration (t*u^M)  
--optimal ETAS predictor: level set of conditional intensity  
---MDA is pretty close to the "true data" if treating ETAS as the truth.  
* ETAS:  
--some events are unpredictable 'background' mainshocks  
--some are aftershocks  
--aftershocks can have aftershocks  
--empirical relationships:  
---Gutenberg-Richter law for magnitude: power law for magnitude/frequency  
---Omori-Utsu law for aftershocks: rate of aftershocks decays like power law  
--magnitude independent of time, same distribution for main and aftershocks  
--model events above some threshold magnitude m_0  
--Gutenberg-Richter law for magnitude:   
---N proportional to 10^(-b*M)  
---p(M|m_0)  
--Omori-Utsu law for aftershocks:  
---probability density for aftershocks after the i-th event
* Fitting ETAS to data:  
--Maximum likelihood  
--implemented as EM  
--etas.f  
* simulating ETAS
* Using ETAS to predict:
--optimal predictor of stochastic process: conditional intensity  
--turn on alarm when the conditional intensity lambda(t) is above some threshold.  

* Next steps:
--access codes  
--install etas.f, import it to python  
--download data from SCEC  
--replicate the results  
--choose periods for training and for testing  
--frame the tuning of MDA and a optimization problem  
--develop an algorithm  
--train and test
