Magnitude-dependent Automatic Alarms  
-----  
* earthquake follow a stocastic process?  
* Rainfall relates with earthquakes?  
* Earthquake probability and metaphor  
* Rabbits Axioms  
--cannot turn a rate into a probability without assuming the phenomenon is random in the first place.  
* casino metaphor  
--the physics of earthquakes might be stocastic  
--stocastic model might provide a compact, accurate description of earthquake phenomenology.  
--stocastic model might be useful for predecting  
* common stocastic models for seismicity:  
--Poisson--doesnt fit  
--Possion for "declustered"--doesnt fit, standard algprothm dont remove enough events to get the test passed.   
--Gamma renewal--doesnt fit  
--ETAS--doesnt fit
