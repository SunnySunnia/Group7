earthquake prediction

*around 'ring of fire';most are on pre-existing faults  
*foreshocks, aftershocks, swarms  
*1 magnitude of 8 earthquake per year, globally  
  
Predicting earthquakes  
------------------------  
*cloud formations  
*electromagnetics in ground and air, resistivity  
*infrared  
*water composition, temperature and level  
*geodetics--measure shape of the earth, using GPS  
*animal behavior  

stochastic models?  
-----------------------  
*Poisson(spatially heterogeneous, temporally homogeneous, marked?)  
-->model earthquake of magnitude greater than *(magtutude threshold), then group a Poisson model  
-->marks are independent of location and time, label maybe magnitude  
-->linear relation on a log-scale  
-->property of Poisson? count of something and the probability of that;  
---->southern CA 2014 with some rate lambda1 vs Kenturky 2014 with some rate lambda2, then the # of earthquakes appear in the two location are independent to each other.  
-->average wait time for the next earthquake=exp(rate)   
-->poisson process, if have earthquake today, you have the wait time, like the clock start over form time 0  


*Gamma renewal processes  
-->start over the clock after a shock  
-->same distribution for the next shock at time after t   

*Weibull, lognormal, normal, double exponential,..  

*ETAS  
-->ecademic time aftershocks  
-->background rate and generate from the aftershocks  

*Brownian passage time  

USGS 1999 Forecast  
P(M>= 6.7 event by 2030) =0.7 +- 0.1
believe 2/3 times it would happen  

Stage 1:  
*determine regional constraints on aggregate fault motions from geodetic measurements  
*map faults and fault segments, identify segments with slip rates. Estimate the slip on each fault segment principally from paleoseismic data, occasionally augmented by geodetic and other data.  
*identify ways in which segments of each fault can reputure separately and together  
*choose at random 1 of 3 generic relationships between fault area and moment release to characterize magnitudes of events
*using the chosen relationship-->build models (2000)
*repeat model thousands of time
Stage 2:  
1. fit 3 types of models for earthquake (possion, Brownian passage,)
2. use models to predict  

**equate frequencies to probabilities.
Earthquake probabilitu is a metaphor.
