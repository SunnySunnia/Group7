Data curator:  
* geographic area  
* time period  
* formats: Json, csv, kml, xml  
* data sources  
* pushing to analyzers


Analyzer:  
* ETAS model  
* input to model  
* pulling from data curator  
* some matlab codes need to be transform into python or R  


Visualizer:  
* graphs? chart? visuals? 
* tools: ipynb? R? 
* D3?  
* maybe some data from ETAS, linecharts  
* from MDA: maybe plot lines onto ETAS-linecharts  


Presenter:  
* story  
* big picture  
* output format  
* presentation  


Plan:
* Worry & Confusion---> Ambiguity & Questions  
* Define  
* Carve the problem up  
* Smart goals:  
--presentation every other Tuesday  
--the non-presenting Tuesday: defining goals  
--the Thursday before presentation day: working period  
--the Thursday after presentation day: retro
* form groups of about 3-4 people  
* In horizentals: abstract, hypothesis  
--showing our MDA model can acheive the same accuracy on predicting earthquakes as the ETAS but simpler than ETAS.  
--create a model simpler than ETAS that makes same predictions.  
* outcomes: same, better, or worse?  


ETAS  
* epidemic-type after shock  
* disease based  
* input parameters(4)
