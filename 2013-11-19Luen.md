* Error diagram  
--ETAS-conditional intensity(high lambda on the left: threshold of turning on the alarm)  
--tao is the fration of time that the alarm is on for the threshold that we picked to turn on the alarm.   
--nu is evaluated at the event time(what proportion of the times that the intensity is greater than x)   
--instead of using lambda, we can look at window length  
--on error diagram, the window length increases  
--for a particular window length, lambda-a function of window function, adjusting for mag
