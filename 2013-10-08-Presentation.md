--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*Group1!  
specialist and generalists  
-four learning styles seem to distrinbute pretty normally.

*Group2:  
-scores of people in different roles(how often do they serve as a producers or others) 
-we had experiences a git merge conflict
takeaway: collaboration and passing/sharing thngs(codes, files)  

*Group3:  


*Group4:  
-roadblock: having problems like virtual machine  
-found some unexpecting fact, maybe there are some problems in designing the survey, or answering the surcey.  
takeaway: eliminated data: removed empty responses; deal with that at the beginning or at the end?  

*Group5:  
-downloaded csv file of the spread sheet for R  
-number of programs that you are comfortable being to a technical lead with  
-study the learning stlyes: in terms of how many programs a person adapt to a stlye feel comfortable to be a technical lead with.

*Group6:  
-no being able to access the ipython example  
-relationship between learning styles and how often a person taking role as a administrator  
-empty cells  
-avg of scores of people reported they always take role as administrators  

*Group7:  
-classes that people have taken  
-pairwise t-tests  
-no significance between classes taken and learning styles  
-heatmaps of correlation  
-communication: cannt meet up at all, instead use online communications  
-violin plots?  

*Group8:  
-learning styles and known computer languages  
-instructions for installing R  
-ANOVA analysis  
-plot: average scores of the styles vs. each programing language  
takeaway: strategies for resolving roadbrocks: github issue, facebook, linking url for images instead of linking files  

*Group9:  
-learning styles and languages  
-process: not able to get everyone to know how to clean the data, short time  
takeaway: how much did you rely on github issue tracker? What is the CS skills you rean people on?  

*Group10:  
-downloaded the spreadsheet then worked in R  
-frequency of each language used: R is the most popular one  
-found that read/wirte learners tend to know fewer programing languages  
-correlation between learning style and known languages: not significant  
-Communication: facebook msgs, emails; ostacles: cannt meet up--email, but email is not efficient enough as affected by frequencies of checking emails
-most standout visualization: word claud

*Group11:  
-learning styles and career goals  
-roadblock: technical problems  
-->profession is the biggest enemy
