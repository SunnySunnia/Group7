* “if there is an earthquake with magnitude greater than the threshold Mτ , predict that there will be an earthquake with magnitude M or above within time t and distance d of the first.”  
--Automatic alarm  
--M, t and d depend on the location or magnitude of the first earthquake  

* Stark compares the VAN predictions to the rule:  
--“If there is an earthquake with magnitude ≥ Mτ , toss a (biased) coin. If the coin lands heads, predict that there will be an earthquake with magnitude ≥ M within time t and distance d of the first. If the coin lands tails, do not make a prediction.”  

* goal:  
--to predict all earthquakes that exceed some threshold magnitude M, that have epicenters in some region R of Earth’s surface, and that occur during some time period T.  

* predictions:  
--Harvard centroid moment tensor (CMT) catalog12 for 2004 and for 2000–2004.  
i) After each earthquake of (body-wave) magnitude Mτ or greater, predict that there will be an earthquake of magnitude Mτ or greater within 21 days, and within 50 km epicentral distance.  
(ii) After each earthquake of magnitude Mτ or greater, predict that there will be an earthquake within 21 days and within 50 km that is at least as large as any within 50 km within 21 days prior to its occurrence.
