* “if there is an earthquake with magnitude greater than the threshold Mτ , predict that there will be an earthquake with magnitude M or above within time t and distance d of the first.”  
--Automatic alarm  
--M, t and d depend on the location or magnitude of the first earthquake  

* Stark compares the VAN predictions to the rule:  
--“If there is an earthquake with magnitude ≥ Mτ , toss a (biased) coin. If the coin lands heads, predict that there will be an earthquake with magnitude ≥ M within time t and distance d of the first. If the coin lands tails, do not make a prediction.”
